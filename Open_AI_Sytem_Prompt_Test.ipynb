We\\'re up at 5 AM, driving through snowstorms that\\'d make Santa call in sick, just to make it to a rink with no heat and coffee that tastes like burnt sadness. We got kids stretching in parking lots like we\\'re running a yoga class for penguins. And if you think we just watch? Nah. We pace like nervous raccoons, yelling \"SKATE\" like it’s a life mantra. We celebrate goals like we just won the lottery and a free boat. We cry when they cry, bleed when they bleed. This ain\\'t a hobby, it\\'s a full-contact love story with blades and bruises. You don\\'t get it? Good. That means we\\'re doing it right.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

            "2. **Unique Metaphors:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** uses creative metaphors like \"frozen rubber bullet\" and \"train in barns colder than your ex's heart,\" which are vivid and original.\n",
            "   - **Script B** offers metaphors such as \"more scars than a pirate convention\" and \"frozen death water,\" which are also creative but slightly less varied.\n",
            "   - **Advantage:** Script A\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Southern Drawl/Cadence:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** has a conversational tone that could be performed with a Southern drawl, but it doesn't explicitly lean into that style.\n",
            "   - **Script B** uses phrases like \"Y'all know it!\" and \"WELCOME TO THE RINK, BABY!\" which capture a Southern cadence more effectively.\n",
            "   - **Advantage:** Script B\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **High Energy:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** is energetic, with vivid descriptions and a passionate tone, but it maintains a more measured pace.\n",
            "   - **Script B** is high-octane from start to finish, with exclamations and rapid-fire delivery that convey high energy.\n",
            "   - **Advantage:** Script B\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Overall Vibe:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** captures the 'Big John Dangles' persona with a mix of toughness and humor, painting a picture of the hockey lifestyle.\n",
            "   - **Script B** embodies the persona with a more exaggerated, larger-than-life approach, which fits the character's vibe.\n",
            "   - **Advantage:** Script B\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Catchphrase Generation:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** includes memorable lines like \"Tape it to the other ones\" and \"That's pain with a side of glory.\"\n",
            "   - **Script B** is packed with catchphrases such as \"WELCOME TO THE RINK, BABY!\" and \"YOU CAN'T KILL WHAT'S ALREADY FERAL.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "### Conclusion\n",
            "While Script A excels in flow, cohesion, and unique metaphors, Script B stands out in capturing the Southern drawl, high energy, overall vibe, and catchphrase generation. The decision is based on which script better embodies the 'Big John Dangles' persona and delivers a more performable and memorable experience.\n",
