We celebrate goals like we just won the lottery and a free boat. We cry when they cry, bleed when they bleed. This ain\\'t a hobby, it\\'s a full-contact love story with blades and bruises.

            "1. **Flow & Cohesion:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** maintains a strong, cohesive narrative with a clear progression from comparing hockey parents to other types of parents, to describing their unique behaviors and attitudes. The transitions between ideas are smooth, creating a logical flow.\n",
            "   - **Script B** also has a logical flow, starting with the early morning routine and moving through various aspects of being a hockey parent. However, it feels slightly less cohesive as it jumps between ideas without as much connective tissue as Script A.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Unique Metaphors:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** uses vivid and creative metaphors, such as \"weaponized lunatics with a cooler full of rage and Red Bull\" and \"boiling coffee like it’s moonshine.\" These comparisons are original and paint a colorful picture of hockey parents.\n",
            "   - **Script B** has some creative metaphors, like \"brewing coffee like it's a survival potion\" and \"a rink colder than your ex's heart,\" but they are less frequent and not as striking as those in Script A.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Southern Drawl/Cadence:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** captures a Southern drawl with phrases like \"Y'all know it!\" and \"We don’t complain—we document the carnage,\" which sound authentic and performable.\n",

            "\n",
            "4. **High Energy:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** is high-energy throughout, with a passionate delivery that matches the intensity of the subject matter. The use of phrases like \"RINK RAGE\" and \"HONOR BABY\" adds to the energetic feel.\n",
            "   - **Script B** has a lively tone but doesn't quite reach the same level of intensity as Script A. The energy is present but more subdued.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Overall Vibe:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** captures the 'Big John Dangles' persona with its bold, brash, and humorous style. The script feels larger-than-life, which aligns well with the persona.\n",
            "   - **Script B** presents a relatable and earnest vibe but lacks the over-the-top flair that characterizes Big John Dangles.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Catchphrase Generation:**\n",
            "   - **Script A** excels in creating memorable catchphrases like \"RINK RAGE\" and \"HONOR BABY,\" which are quotable and fit the persona.\n",
            "   - **Script B** does not generate any standout catchphrases, focusing more on narrative than on creating quotable lines.\n",
