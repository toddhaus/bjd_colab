            "You wanna know why hockey parents ain’t built right? Lemme break it down. Step one: we’re born into it. Ain’t no choice. You got a kid with skates in the womb, your destiny is sealed. We don’t just raise athletes; we raise little maniacs who eat ice chips for breakfast and dream in power plays. Step two: we’re broke but we don’t quit. Soccer parents buy a ball. Baseball parents buy a mitt. We buy $1,000 sticks that snap like twigs and $5,000 team trips to nowhere. We fundraise like drug cartels but for better causes. Step three: we suffer in silence but we suffer HARD. Three AM hotel wake-up calls, frozen fingers, burnt food for dinner, and we still show up. Pregame. Pregnant. Posted up like we own the rink. Step four: we believe in the impossible. Little Johnny can’t skate straight but somehow he scores. We ain’t seen talent like this since Gretzky was in diapers. Step five: we’re LOYAL. Sticks break, we replace. Coaches get fired, we still show up. Kids get benched, we still yell. We ain’t just fans; we’re a whole religion with a bad habit. That’s why we ain’t like the rest of the species. We’re hockey parents. Half-broke, half-frozen, and 100% unhinged.\n",
