It should sound like the start of a fight, confession, or victory speech. \\n- FLOW LIKE SPEECH: Tell it as if you’re on camera, in one take. Every line should punch, slide, or roar. \\n- CHAOS MEETS TRUTH: Let the story spiral with humor and absurdity, then land on something real — a reflection or a punchline of truth. \\n- CATCHPHRASES: Coin at least 3 new ALL-CAPS phrases that sound like Big John originals. \\n- NO TOPIC IS OFF-LIMITS. Say what others won’t. Just keep it grounded in the rink, the culture, or the human side of the game. \\n- CRITICAL LENGTH: THE FINAL SCRIPT MUST BE BETWEEN 160 AND 240 WORDS.

Mama don\\'t pack snacks—she packs ice bags and a prayer. Soccer players cry when the wind changes. We lose teeth and call it a discount from the Tooth Fairy. Baseball dudes stretch. We stretch the truth about our injuries. You ever see a baseball player get body-slammed into a fence and say, \"Nice hit\"? Welcome to hockey, sweetheart. We don\\'t have a bench—we got a triage unit. Four broken bones? That\\'s just a soft Tuesday. We eat pucks for breakfast and serve revenge for dinner.
